# dynflows
A Python implementation of various algorithms for network flows over time. This includes
- the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for maximum flows over time,
- the algorithm for lex-max flows over time by Hoppe and Tardos,
- Orlin's algorithm for submodular function minimization,
- feasibility determination by minimizing the submodular function $`v^T`$,
- computing a minimum feasible time horizon using a binary search,
- the algorithm for integral dynamic transshipments by Hoppe and Tardos.
